If you are an educator who is interested in starting a course like this one, you are welcome to contact Prof. Haynes Miller (hrm@math.mit.edu) and Susan Ruff (ruff@math.mit.edu).

The following resources provide further background and context supporting this course.

*   On June 21, 2013, Prof. Haynes Miller gave a presentation about _Project Laboratory in Mathematics_ at the New Directions for Mathematics Research Experiences for Undergraduates conference. [A project laboratory in mathematics (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit18_821s13_mtholyoke_prs) is the slide deck used in his presentation.
*   On July 31, 2013, Susan Ruff gave a presentation about supporting teamwork in _Project Laboratory in Mathematics_ for [Project NExT](http://archives.math.utk.edu/projnext/). [Supporting Teamwork In MIT's _Project Lab In Mathematics_ (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit18_821s13_next_prs) is the slide deck used in her presentation.
*   A wealth of resources for teaching mathematical communication is available at [MathDL Mathematical Communication](http://mathcomm.org/courses/math-lab-class/), a website hosted by the MAA and co-edited by Prof. Haynes Miller and Susan Ruff. The site originated in the MIT Department of Mathematics and includes resources about this class as well as a wide range of resources for teaching math students to write and give presentations.
