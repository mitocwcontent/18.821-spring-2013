To illustrate the writing and revision process for the student papers, two sample projects are presented below.

Sample Paper 1: The Dynamics of Successive Differences Over ℤ and ℝ
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This project developed from the project description for [Number Squares (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit18_821s13_pjct_num_sq). To view the practice presentation and final presentation from this team of students, see the [Sample Student Presentations]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/presentations) page.
